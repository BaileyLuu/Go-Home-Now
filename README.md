# Go-Home-Now

The obbjective of this game is you have to go home safely without letting the viruses infect you (once the virus infect you, it is game over). When you first start the game, a counsellor named Vaccyne will guide you through the whole process and explain the safety measure to protect yourself. 
The pickups in the game are face masks, water, sanitizer and each time you collect one of these, you will earn points. According to World Health Organization, you need to wear face masks, clean your hands and bring sanitizer (in the case of needs), to protect yourself.
